Current Project Status:

Working:
-can add media to lists
-added media corresponds to list that it was added to automatically
-all media is automatically added to persistent database
-media can be deleted from list by swiping right
-can add image from camera roll

to do next:
-grouped media within list by starting letter
-more info per media item -> not sure quite what to do with this, would probably have to create subclasses for each media type for this to make sense
-make media items like a todo list with media that you've consumed vs are consuming vs will consume
